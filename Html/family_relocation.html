                                <h4>How long does it take to buy a property in Cyprus?</h4>
                                <p>Answer: The whole procedure for pur-chasing property in Cyprus should only take about
                                    1-3 months. Of course, each situation is different and this timeframe may vary from
                                    one individual to another. Our relocation services aim to simplify this process by
                                    providing guidance and assistance from start to finish. </p>

                                <p>Answer: While a residency card can be obtained within two months through the
                                    fast-track process, a permanent resident of Cyprus can apply for Cyprus Citizenship
                                    after completing 5 years (1825 days) of legal stay in Cyprus, according to the
                                    naturalization scheme based on years of residence (M127). Once acquired, permanent
                                    residency in Cyprus is valid for life. </p>
