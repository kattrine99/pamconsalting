                                <h4>Question: How long does it take to become a permanent resident in Cyprus?</h4>
                                <p>Answer: While a residency card can be obtained within two months through the
                                    fast-track process, a permanent resident of Cyprus can apply for Cyprus Citizenship
                                    after completing 5 years (1825 days) of legal stay in Cyprus, according to the
                                    naturalization scheme based on years of residence (M127). Once acquired, permanent
                                    residency in Cyprus is valid for life. </p>
